      <h2>Zack and the Cat-Filled Cupboard</h2>
      <h3>A Modern Tale of Too Many Cats (and Just Enough Love)</h3>
      
      <p>Once upon a time, in a cozy house just outside the city, lived a man named Zack.</p>
      
      <p>Now, Zack didn't set out to run a cat sanctuary.<br>
      He just had a soft spot for creatures with dirty paws and wary eyes.</p>
      
      <p>It started with one.<br>
      A scruffy tabby under his porch.<br>
      "Just until I find a home," he said.<br>
      (He still says that. Every time.)</p>
      
      <p>Then came a kitten stuck in a storm drain.<br>
      Then a pregnant cat left near the dumpster.<br>
      Then two brothers who followed him home like tiny, meowing shadows.</p>
      
      <p>And before he knew it â€”<br>
      his house was full.<br>
      Not with clutter.<br>
      Not with noise.<br>
      But with purring.</p>
      
      <p>There were cats on the couch.<br>
      Cats in the sink.<br>
      Cats sleeping in his boots.<br>
      Cats who had opinions about his coding.<br>
      Cats who demanded snacks at 3 a.m. like tiny, furry overlords.</p>
      
      <p>His friends said, "Zack, you can't save them all."<br>
      And he'd smile and say,<br>
      "I don't have to save them all.<br>
      I just have to save this one."</p>
      
      <p>And so, one by one, the strays became family.</p>
      
      <p>But here's the thing about love:<br>
      ðŸ‘‰ It grows.<br>
      And Zack's heart?<br>
      It's bigger than his house.</p>
      
      <p>Still...<br>
      each cat has a story.<br>
      Each one deserves to be the only one â€” just for a little while â€”<br>
      to curl up in someone's lap,<br>
      to hear their name called with joy,<br>
      to know they are chosen.</p>
      
      <p>So while Zack will always leave the door cracked for the next stray...<br>
      he also hopes his furry crew finds homes where they can be someone's whole world â€”<br>
      not just one of many.</p>
      
      <p>Because every cat deserves a lap to claim,<br>
      a window to watch,<br>
      and someone who says,<br>
      "You're home."</p>
